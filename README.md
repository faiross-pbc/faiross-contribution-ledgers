# Managing Contribution Credit

This is a template concept for how open source projects could manage contribution credit for their project(s). We hope that with the help of our community, we can begin to understand answers to questions like:

* How can open-source projects manage credit for project contributions or upstream/downstream dependencies?

* Who is/should determine the value of a project contribution or dependency?

* Would the assigned value of a contribution change over time? Is time irrelevant to the assignment of value?

* How do contribution value and project value relate?

For many projects, attribution of contribution credit doesn’t occur formally, if at all. In many cases it is simply a decision to merge or not merge.

```The intent here is to begin to design methods that allow a flow of credit (financial, social, academic, etc…) from projects to their contributors and projects of interest.```

As a starting point, we created 2 files. We don’t know where these files will live in the development or project management process or what form the overall solution will take. For the moment, they are simple text ledgers, a place for projects to assign value.

* **contribution_ledger.txt** - A file representing the names of contributors and their credit allocations

* **project_ledger.txt** - A file representing the upstream and (potentially) downstream projects that are important to the assigning project
